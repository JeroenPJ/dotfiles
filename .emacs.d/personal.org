* ssh-servers
I would like to run emacs locally and edit server files. Among others, this
would allow for in-line image display (with C-c C-o). I would also like the
emacs shell to open in server directory and not in my home directory. My
approach is to mount the server on =/mnt/mlp/=, and now define the new home Dir
as =/mnt/mlp/home/paul/=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; (setq user-init-file "/home/paul/.emacs.d/init.el")
  ;; (setenv "HOME" "/mnt/mlp/home/paul/")
  ;; (setq home-directory "/mnt/mlp/home/paul/em")
#+END_SRC

Let's define functions to set the default directory so finding remote files is
easier.
